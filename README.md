# Career-Considerations
I have researched prospective career considerations and attempted it to be open-sourced for the betterment of all friends.

## To begin with,
After re-taking Korean SAT in late 2017, I have experienced around 3+ interns and freelancing job in several companies with just few semesters for concentrating on academic works. Since time starts to urge me to decide my potential career path, considering several options based on my performance on working places. It is **NOT** deniable that there is fundamental founding on myself to have rudimentary interests in understanding the human dynamics in general. 

Yes, Tech scene will act upon as augmented skillset for the betterment of researching thereby understanding the dynamics of society. That drives me to have interest in a data-related career path with a much larger scale, from back-end engineering to data science(statistics). Anyhow, it is clear that just after finishing up my military duties as soon as possible, declaring the primary major from existing "interdisciplinary studies" (so-called still around freshman or so) is important and do prepare the afterward given my career choice.

## What I am going to do in this repository?
Trying to collect lots of papers, interviews, articles from the journal, and even job description on LinkedIn or similar sites for better understanding the dynamics. Repos will be generally focused on data science or economic-based research field.
