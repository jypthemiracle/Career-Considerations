# Career-Considerations
I have researched prospective career considerations and attempted it to be open-sourced for betterment of others also.

## To begin with,
After taking Korean SAT in the late 2017, I have experienced around 3+ interns and freelancing job in several companies. Since time starts to urge me to decide my potential career path, considering several options based on my performance on working places. It is **NOT** deniable that there is fundamental founding on myself to have rudimentary interests in understanding society in general. 

Yes, Tech scene will act upon as augmented skillset for the betterment of researching thereby understanding the dynamics of society. That drives me to have interest in data-related career path with much larger scale, from back-end engineering to data science(statistics). Anyhow, it is clear that declaring the primary major from existing "interdisciplinary studies" (so-called still around freshman or so) and prepare the afterwards given my career choice.

## What I am going to do in this repository?
Trying to collect lots of papers, interviews, articles from journal, and even job description on LinkedIn or similiar sites for better understanding the dynamics. Repos will be generally focused on data science or economic-based research field.
