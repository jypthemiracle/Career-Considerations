논문의 원본은 GitHub에 올려두었습니다. 몇 가지 내용을 요약하도록 하겠습니다.

* Economists have begun to play a growing role in the tech sector, and as companies have sought guidance on how to bring economists into their companies.
	* Amazon: hired 150+ PhD economists. New hires have ranged from a [chief economist](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pat-bajari-00a31313/) (who was previously a tenured economics professor) to newly minted PhDs.
	* Companies ranging from Google, Facebook, and Microsoft to Airbnb and Uber now all have large teams of PhD economists.

* Economics has developed a toolkit for investigating empirical relationships, focusing on techniques to help understand which correlations speak to a causal relationship and which do not.
	* They are assigned to work on specific business problems throughout the company, like:
		* [Does Uber Express Pool grow the full Uber user base](https://hbr.org/2018/11/using-experiments-to-launch-new-products), or simply draw in users from other Uber products? 
		* [Should eBay advertise on Google](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43616924), or does this simply syphon off people who would have come through organic search anyway? 
			* In reality, eBay’s advertising analysis found that they had been wasting millions of dollars by inefficiently advertising on Google.
		* [Are African-American Airbnb users rejected on the basis of their race](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20160213)?
* Economists are expected to complement intution with data on causal inference: especially in tech sector, where data abounds and experimentation is feasible.

* Economists have thought about the design of markets and incentives, and this work has found new applications in the digital economy. Bringing economic theory into the design of marketplaces can have a big impact.
	* Economics research has thought carefully about the [role of consumer search in shaping the design of auctions for digital advertising](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/126/3/1213/1854397).

* Companies are often unsure of how to begin creating an economics team. In practice, the range of roles is large. The answers will dictate where economists might create value in the company.

* 5 Questions Economists Can Help Tech Companies Answer, the followings are:
	* What are your goals around user growth, profitability, fairness, etc, and how is the design of your platform affecting them?
	* Are scale economies important for your company, your suppliers, or your customers?
	* How is your company affecting the world?
	* Can economics improve your management practices and decision making?
	* How are you thinking about your data assets?

* Tech data can also be used to develop valuable analytics packages, or result in new products entirely. In other words, while it’s great to be product focused, online platforms are often a microcosm for society, offering a testing ground for broad societal questions.
	* Using Yelp data to understand the minimum wage helps policymakers, while also helping Yelp to understand its own data and have a seat at the broader policy table.
